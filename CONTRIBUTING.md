# Contributing (PRE-GENESIS)

This repository is in a PRE-GENESIS state.

It is not an open contribution environment in the conventional sense.

---

## Canonical Boundary

The Core (axioms and canonical definitions) is not open to modification.

- No pull requests modifying the Core will be accepted.
- No discussions reinterpret the Core.
- Any change to the Core constitutes a fork (a different system).

---

## What Can Be Discussed

Before Genesis, discussion may occur only in non-canonical areas, such as:

- explanatory texts and translations
- tooling, formatting, and verification utilities
- pilots, templates, and procedural mechanisms
- external critiques and analyses

Acceptance of any contribution is discretionary.

---

## Language Rule

Canonical meaning is bound to Russian-language texts.

Translations are explanatory only and do not define meaning.

---

## No Promise of Inclusion

Submission of ideas, texts, or code does not imply acceptance.

There is no obligation to merge, respond, or engage.

---

## After Genesis

After Genesis anchoring:

- the Core becomes immutable
- contribution rules may be redefined
- forks become the only mechanism for altering axioms

Until then, this repository functions as a controlled workspace.

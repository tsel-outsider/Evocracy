# Languages and Canonical Meaning

Evocracy is a formal system.  
Formal systems require **stable semantics**.

This document defines how languages are used within Evocracy and how canonical meaning is determined.

---

## Canonical Language

The **canonical language** of Evocracy is:

> **Russian (RU)**

Canonical meaning, axioms, and definitions are bound to the Russian-language texts stored under: `canon/ru/`.

Only these texts define:

- axiomatic meaning
- binding definitions
- canonical interpretation

---

## Translations

Translations into other languages (e.g. EN, JA, ZH):

- are provided for accessibility
- aim for semantic fidelity
- may lag behind the canonical texts

Translations are **not sources of canonical meaning**.

If a discrepancy exists between a translation and the Russian canonical text:

> The Russian canonical text prevails.

This rule is absolute and non-negotiable.

---

## Why Russian Is Canonical

Canonical language selection is not political.

Russian is used because:

- it allows high semantic density
- it tolerates controlled ambiguity where required
- it supports precise formal reasoning
- certain meanings cannot be translated without loss

This choice is architectural.

## Multiple Languages, One Canon

Evocracy supports:

- multiple languages
- multiple implementations
- multiple national adaptations

But only **one canonical semantic source**.

This prevents:
- semantic drift
- hidden reinterpretation
- translation-based governance capture

---

## National Implementations

National or local implementations may:

- adapt procedures
- adapt templates
- adapt operational layers

They may **not** modify or reinterpret:

- the Core axioms
- canonical definitions

Such implementations are considered **forks outside the Canon**.

---

## Summary

- Canonical language: Russian (RU)
- Canonical source: `canon/ru/`
- Translations: official but non-canonical
- Semantic conflicts: resolved in favor of RU
- Governance integrity depends on this separation

---

## 1. Definitions

**Materials**  
All documents, specifications, text, diagrams, and assets contained in this repository.

**Canonical Materials**  
Materials intended to become canon after Genesis anchoring, including (but not limited to) the RU canonical layer under `canon/ru/` and any Genesis-anchored artifacts referenced by published hashes or TxIDs.

**Non-Canonical Materials**  
All other materials, including explanatory texts, translations, community documents, templates, pilots, examples, and utilities.

**Marks**  
The names and identifiers **“Evocracy”**, **“Evocracy Project”**, and the Evocracy symbol/logo (including `assets/symbol/evocracy-symbol.svg`), as well as any confusingly similar names or identifiers used to suggest origin, endorsement, or canonical status.

**Fork**  
Any modified, adapted, extended, translated, or otherwise derivative version of any Materials.

---

## 2. Permissions

You are permitted to:

1) **Read, copy, and redistribute** the Materials (verbatim) for any purpose.  
2) **Create Forks**, including modifications, adaptations, and translations.  
3) **Publish and distribute Forks**, provided you comply with the conditions below.

No permission is granted to use the Marks except as explicitly allowed by this license.

---

## 3. Conditions (Required)

### 3.1 Attribution
Any redistribution (verbatim or Fork) must provide attribution, in a reasonable and visible form:

- “Evocracy” (as the source name), and
- a reference to the original repository, and
- the title of the redistributed material (if applicable).

### 3.2 Canon Integrity (No Canon Substitution)
Canonical Materials may be redistributed **only in unmodified form**.

You may not present any modified text as:
- “the Evocracy canon”,
- “official Evocracy Core”, or
- “Genesis-anchored Evocracy”.

Canonical authenticity is defined solely by **published hashes, signatures, and Genesis anchoring**, not by claims, presentation, or branding.

### 3.3 Fork Transparency (No Confusion)
If you publish a Fork, you must:

- clearly label it as a **Fork** or **Modified version**,
- state that it is **not canonical**,
- describe the nature of the changes (high level is sufficient), and
- avoid any presentation that could mislead readers into believing the Fork is canonical, official, or endorsed.

### 3.4 Use of Marks (Name & Logo Policy)
You may use the Marks **only** to:

- make truthful references (e.g., “Fork of Evocracy”, “Based on Evocracy”), or
- cite or discuss Evocracy as a concept or system.

You may **not** use the Marks to:

- name or brand a Fork as “Evocracy” or “Evocracy Project”,
- present a Fork as an official or canonical version,
- imply endorsement, authorship, or canonical status,
- use the Evocracy name or symbol/logo as the primary branding of a Fork.

Any national, local, or thematic adaptation must use a **distinct name** and a **distinct visual identity**.

### 3.5 Translations
Translations are permitted, but must be labeled as **non-canonical** unless explicitly designated otherwise.

If a translation conflicts with the RU canonical texts, the RU canonical texts prevail for canonical meaning.

## 4. No Warranty

The Materials are provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind.
No responsibility or liability is assumed for any use of the Materials.

---

## 5. Termination

If you violate the conditions in Section 3, your permissions under this license terminate automatically.
Permissions may be reinstated if the violation is cured and the misleading use ceases.

---

## 6. Minimal Interpretation Rule

If any clause of this license is unenforceable in a jurisdiction, it shall be interpreted narrowly to preserve the intent:

- protect Canon integrity,
- allow forks with clear labeling,
- prevent confusion, name, symbol, or canon capture.

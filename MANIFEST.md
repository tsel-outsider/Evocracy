# Evocracy — Pre-Genesis Manifest

This document defines the scope, intent, and boundaries of the Evocracy project
**prior to Genesis**.

It does not define axioms.
It does not define procedures.
It defines responsibility.

---

## Status

**Status:** PRE-GENESIS  
This manifest is informational and non-canonical.

No document referenced here currently has immutable or canonical status.

---

## Purpose of This Manifest

The purpose of this manifest is to:

- declare architectural intent
- define future canonical scope
- prevent ambiguity about what will be anchored at Genesis
- distinguish drafts from canon
- establish verification expectations in advance

This manifest exists to avoid retroactive interpretation.

---

## Canonical Scope (Planned)

At Genesis, the following artifacts will become canonical:

- Core axioms (Russian language)
- Canonical definitions required for axiomatic interpretation
- Canonical glossary (Russian language)

These artifacts will be:

- finalized
- cryptographically signed
- hashed
- anchored in Arweave

After Genesis, they will be immutable.

---

## Non-Canonical Scope

The following are **not canonical** and will not be anchored as immutable:

- Outer Core
- Procedures
- Parameters
- Templates
- Pilots
- Examples
- Translations
- Community proposals
- National or local adaptations

These layers may evolve independently, provided they do not violate the Core axioms.

---

## Canonical Language

The canonical language of Evocracy is **Russian (RU)**.

All canonical meaning is bound to Russian-language texts stored under: `canon/ru/`.

Translations into other languages are provided for accessibility only and are not sources of canonical meaning.

---

## Genesis Event (Definition)

Genesis is a one-time event that consists of:

1. Finalization of canonical Core artifacts
2. Publication of cryptographic hashes
3. Cryptographic signature of hash manifest
4. Anchoring of the canonical artifacts in Arweave
5. Publication of verification instructions

Genesis activates canonical status.

Before Genesis, no canonical status exists.

---

## Verification Model (Planned)

After Genesis, verification will rely on:

- Arweave transaction ID(s)
- Published cryptographic hashes
- Public verification keys
- Deterministic verification instructions

Verification does not rely on trust in identities.

---

## Repository Role

This repository serves as:

- a development workspace
- a public mirror
- a structural reference

It does not serve as a canonical authority.

Canonical authority derives exclusively from anchored artifacts.

---

## Change Policy

Before Genesis:
- changes are expected
- drafts are normal
- revisions do not imply forks

After Genesis:
- canonical artifacts never change
- any modification constitutes a fork (new system)
- evolution continues outside the Canon

---

## No Assumptions

This manifest makes no assumptions about:

- adoption
- governance
- jurisdiction
- enforcement
- timelines

Evocracy stands or falls on internal coherence alone.

---

## Closing Note

This manifest exists so that Genesis,
when it occurs,
will not be ambiguous.

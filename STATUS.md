# Evocracy — Repository Status

## Current Status: PRE-GENESIS

This repository is currently in **PRE-GENESIS** state.

This means:

- The canonical Core (axioms) has **not yet been anchored**.
- No document in this repository currently has canonical or immutable status.
- Texts, structures, and formulations may change.
- Development drafts may be added, revised, or removed.

GitHub at this stage serves as:

- a development workspace  
- a public mirror of progress  
- a structural reference  

GitHub is **not** the source of canonical truth.

## What is Genesis

**Genesis** is a one-time event that activates canonical status.

Genesis includes:

1. Finalization of the Core (axioms)
2. Cryptographic signature
3. Publication of hashes
4. Arweave anchoring (TxID)

Only after Genesis:

- The Core becomes immutable
- Fork semantics become strict
- Canonical interpretation rules activate

---

## Until Genesis

Before Genesis:

- Drafts are normal
- Edits are normal
- Structural changes are normal
- No fork semantics are triggered by revisions

Documents may contain PRE-GENESIS DRAFT notices — these are intentional and authoritative.

---

## After Genesis (planned rule)

After Genesis:

- The Core will never be modified
- Any modification attempt constitutes a fork (new system)
- Evolution is allowed only in Outer Core and non-canonical layers

---

## Verification (future)

After Genesis, canonical verification will rely on:

- Arweave TxID
- Cryptographic signatures
- Published hashes

Verification instructions will be published in `CANON.md`.

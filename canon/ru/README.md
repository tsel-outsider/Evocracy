# Evocracy — Canon (RU)

This directory contains the **canonical Russian-language** layer of Evocracy.

Canonical meaning, axioms, and definitions are bound to the Russian-language texts stored under: `canon/ru/`.

---

## Status

**Current status:** PRE-GENESIS

Until Genesis anchoring, this directory may contain placeholders and/or working drafts.
Canonical status activates only after Genesis.

---

## Canonical Scope (after Genesis)

After Genesis, the canonical scope includes:

- Core axioms (`core/`)
- Canonical definitions required for axiomatic interpretation
- Canonical glossary (RU)

These artifacts will be:

- hashed
- cryptographically signed
- anchored in Arweave
- immutable

---

## Non-Canonical Layers

The following are **not canonical** and may evolve:

- procedures and parameters (Outer Core)
- templates, pilots, examples
- translations into other languages
- community proposals and national adaptations

Canonical status does not extend beyond the anchored Canon artifacts.

---

## Immutability Rule (after Genesis)

After Genesis:

- canonical files are never modified
- any modification constitutes a fork (new system)
- evolution continues outside the Canon

There is no “partial” change of the Canon.

---

## Language Rule

If any semantic conflict exists between:

- a translation (EN/JA/ZH/…)
- a non-canonical document
- a national or local adaptation

and the canonical RU texts:

> The canonical RU texts prevail.

This rule is absolute.

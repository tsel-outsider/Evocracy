# Canon — Evocracy

This directory defines the **canonical layer** of Evocracy.

Canonical means:

- foundational
- axiomatic
- interpretation-binding
- immutable after Genesis

---

## Canonical Language

The canonical language of Evocracy is:

> **Russian (RU)**

Canonical meaning, axioms, and definitions are bound to the Russian-language texts stored under: `canon/ru/`. Canonical glossary resides under `canon/ru/`.

Translations into other languages are:

- official when marked as such
- carefully maintained
- useful for access and adoption

But translations are **not canonical sources of meaning**.

If semantic conflict exists between a translation and the Russian canonical text:

> The Russian canonical text prevails.

---

## Canon Activation

Canonical status is **not active yet** (PRE-GENESIS).

Canonical status activates only after Genesis:

- Core finalized
- Signed
- Anchored in Arweave
- Hashes published

Until Genesis:

- Canon files may be empty
- Canon placeholders may exist
- Drafts may live outside this directory

This is intentional.

---

## Canon Scope

The Canon layer includes:

- Core axioms
- Foundational definitions
- Binding interpretation rules

The Canon layer excludes:

- procedures
- parameters
- pilot mechanics
- templates
- operational details

Those belong to Outer Core and other layers.

---

## Immutability Rule (after Genesis)

After Genesis:

- Canon files are never modified
- Corrections require a new Genesis-level release
- Any altered Canon is a forked system

No partial Canon edits exist.

---

## Purpose of Separation

The separation between Canon and Outer layers exists to ensure:

- stability of principles
- flexibility of implementation
- resistance to semantic drift
- resistance to procedural capture

Architecture first. Evolution second.

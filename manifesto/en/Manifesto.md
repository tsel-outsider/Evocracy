# Manifesto: Evocracy (non-canonical)

**Status:** PRE-GENESIS  
This text is explanatory. It does **not** define the canon and does **not** replace the Core.  
Canonical meaning will be bound to the RU Core after Genesis anchoring; if definitions conflict, the Core prevails.

## Thesis

**Evocracy** is power as service to the common good: power is a **duty without privileges**, decisions are permitted only through a strict **allowlist of formal templates**, and abuse is prevented “by default” because everything relies on **verifiable artifacts**, **automatic stop-triggers**, and **personal accountability**.

Evocracy is not about replacing power.  
It is about replacing the **principles by which power is built**.

---

## Why

Corruption emerges where there are privileges, back channels, discretion (“allowed by a decision”), and impunity.  
Evocracy removes incentives and loopholes **at the rules level**:

- you cannot act outside a formally defined template (everything else is forbidden);
- you cannot obtain personal benefit (including perks and in-kind advantages);
- you cannot hide decisions or money: without verifiable artifacts, a decision is not executable.

---

## Core Principles

1) **Power = duty, not privilege.** Personal gain is incompatible with authority.

2) **Allowlist of actions.** Only what is defined in final templates is permitted; formulations like “other/any/necessary” are unacceptable.

3) **Privileges are banned by design.** Compensation and any “benefits” are constrained; expenses are allowed only under strict rules and with demonstrable public benefit.

4) **Unexplained wealth is not debated — it is blocked.** For holders of authority (and related persons), unexplained assets become legally unusable and trigger a public verification procedure.

5) **Verifiability matters more than words.** Any material decision is executable only together with a verification package, data, and a reproducible calculation; where secrecy is necessary, it is allowed only with a mandatory disclosure protocol afterwards.

6) **Automatic accountability.** There are stop-triggers: a breach of conditions → automatic pause/rejection/recall; “collective anonymity” does not protect anyone — every action has a personally accountable owner.

7) **Voting is a choice, not a justification.** No majority legitimizes violations: choices are made only among what is already formally permissible.

## Responsibility of Authority and Responsibility of Society

Evocracy requires responsibility from both sides.

**Duties of authority:** act only within allowlisted templates, publish evidence, pass verification and audits, maintain a reproducible log, meet time-bound obligations, and conduct regular public reviews.

**Duties of society:** do not “believe” — **verify**: read the artifacts, reproduce calculations, participate in public review windows, initiate checks, and join juries/panels under rules of proof of personhood and lottery. Without this, any system becomes a façade.

---

## What Evocracy Is Not

- not a party and not an ideology;
- not “Democracy 2.0”;
- not “rule by experts” without constraints;
- not “total transparency”: privacy is allowed only where it is compatible with verifiability and disclosure protocols, not by “trust us.”

---

## Genesis and the Right to Fork

**Genesis** is a one-time canon fixation: finalization of the Core, publication of hashes, signatures, anchoring, and verification. After Genesis the Core is immutable; any edit of the Core is a fork (a different system).

---

## Conclusion

Evocracy is an attempt to build power so that it is **hard** to be bad and **impossible** to hide consequences.

Power is a burden. Accept the rules — serve. If you cannot — do not take it.
